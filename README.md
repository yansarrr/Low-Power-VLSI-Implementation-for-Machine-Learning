# Low-Power-VLSI-Implementation-for-Machine-Learning
VLSI ML accelerator course offers a practical guide to VLSI design for ML accelerator architectures, covering algorithms, architecture, and circuit design. It includes theory and practical work on training and inference of deep neural networks and various ML algorithms in PyTorch. Students develop and validate network models for computer vision and NLP applications. Hardware implementation involves employing low-power techniques such as quantization, pruning, compression, and sparsity-aware circuit techniques. Through Verilog programming, students craft their architectures and validate functionality using Python test benches. The final stage includes synthesis and assessment using Quartus Prime for FPGA emulations.
